## üéØ Critical Scenes (Don't Skip!)

### üî• Scene 6: Auto-Scaling (7:00-9:00) - **MOST IMPORTANT**
**Worth 3 marks + shows microservices working**

**Must show:**
1. ‚úÖ Transcode Worker desired count = **0** (before upload)
2. ‚úÖ Upload video ‚Üí wait 30-60 seconds
3. ‚úÖ Refresh ECS service ‚Üí desired count = **1** (auto-scaled)
4. ‚úÖ Task status: PENDING ‚Üí RUNNING
5. ‚úÖ Click task ‚Üí show logs processing video
6. ‚úÖ SQS queue: 1 message ‚Üí 0 messages (after processing)
7. ‚úÖ Worker will scale back to 0 after cooldown (mention it)

**Script:**
> "Watch the Transcode Worker scale from zero to one automatically based on the SQS queue depth. This is the key advantage of event-driven architecture..."

---

### ‚ö° Scene 3: Load Balancer (2:00-3:30) - **4 MARKS**
**Worth: HTTPS (2) + Load Distribution (2)**

**Must show:**
1. ‚úÖ ALB Listeners: Port 443 (HTTPS), Port 80 (redirect)
2. ‚úÖ Rules: `/api/admin/*` ‚Üí Admin TG, `/api/*` ‚Üí Video API TG
3. ‚úÖ Target Groups: Show healthy targets (2-5, 1-3)
4. ‚úÖ Run curl command:
   ```bash
   curl -I https://n11817143-videoapp.cab432.com/api/config
   # Should show: HTTP/2 200
   ```

---

### üöÄ Scene 5: Serverless (5:00-7:00) - **4 MARKS**
**Worth: Serverless (2) + Communication (2)**

**Must show:**
1. ‚úÖ Lambda function: `n11817143-s3-to-sqs-lambda`
2. ‚úÖ CloudWatch logs: Show recent invocation
3. ‚úÖ SQS queue: Show message with video details
4. ‚úÖ Explain flow: S3 ‚Üí Lambda ‚Üí SQS ‚Üí Worker

## üìã Pre-Recording Checklist

**5 Minutes Before Recording:**
- [ ] Close unnecessary tabs/windows
- [ ] Set Transcode Worker desired count to **0**
- [ ] Clear browser cache (or use incognito)
- [ ] Have test video ready (demo-video.mp4, 100-500MB)
- [ ] Zoom browser to 125% for readability
- [ ] Test microphone audio

**Open These Tabs:**
- [ ] Frontend: https://app.n11817143-videoapp.cab432.com
- [ ] AWS Console ‚Üí ECS ‚Üí Clusters
- [ ] AWS Console ‚Üí Lambda
- [ ] AWS Console ‚Üí SQS
- [ ] AWS Console ‚Üí CloudFront
- [ ] AWS Console ‚Üí EC2 ‚Üí Load Balancers
- [ ] Terminal (SSH or local)

## üé§ Key Phrases to Say

### Introduction
> "Hi, I'm Aswanth Raj, student n11817143. This demonstrates my CAB432 Assignment 3 microservices architecture."

### Microservices
> "I've deployed three microservices: Video API for user requests, Admin Service for management, and Transcode Worker for video processing."

### Auto-Scaling (Critical!)
> "Notice the worker is at zero tasks. When I upload a video, it will automatically scale up based on the SQS queue depth, process the video, then scale back to zero to save costs."

### Load Balancing
> "The ALB uses path-based routing. Admin requests go to the Admin Service, while API requests route to the Video API. HTTPS is enforced with automatic HTTP-to-HTTPS redirects."

### Serverless
> "When the video uploads to S3, it triggers a Lambda function that validates the file and sends a message to SQS. This decouples the upload from processing."

### DLQ
> "Failed jobs after three retries move to a dead letter queue. A CloudWatch alarm notifies me when this happens."

### IaC
> "All infrastructure is deployed with Terraform. These 35+ resources can be recreated with a single command."

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes to Avoid

‚ùå **DON'T:**
- Rush through auto-scaling (it's worth 3 marks!)
- Forget to show the worker scaling from 0‚Üí1
- Skip showing actual logs and metrics
- Show sensitive credentials or keys
- Record in resolution lower than 1080p
- Mumble or speak too quietly

‚úÖ **DO:**
- Pause between scenes (easier to edit later)
- Explain WHY each component exists
- Show features WORKING (not just configuration)
- Keep energy in your voice
- Point out marks: "This demonstrates auto-scaling for 3 marks"
- Refresh pages to show real-time updates

---

## üîß Emergency Commands

### If Worker Won't Scale Automatically:
```bash
# Manually set to 1 for demo
aws ecs update-service \
  --cluster n11817143-app-cluster \
  --service transcode-worker \
  --desired-count 1
```

### If Services Are Down:
```bash
# Check service status
aws ecs describe-services \
  --cluster n11817143-app-cluster \
  --services video-api admin-service transcode-worker

# Restart service
aws ecs update-service \
  --cluster n11817143-app-cluster \
  --service <service-name> \
  --force-new-deployment
```

### If Frontend Won't Load:
- Check CloudFront distribution status
- Try direct S3 URL as fallback
- Clear browser cache and retry

### Test Everything Works:
```bash
# Test API
curl https://n11817143-videoapp.cab432.com/api/config

# List ECS services
aws ecs list-services --cluster n11817143-app-cluster

# Check Lambda
aws lambda list-functions | grep s3-to-sqs

# Check SQS queues
aws sqs list-queues | grep n11817143
```

- [ ] Test link works (open in incognito)
- [ ] Copy link to report

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Practice once** before recording (don't memorize, just get familiar)
2. **Have water nearby** (dry mouth happens!)
3. **Take a deep breath** before starting each scene
4. **Smile while talking** (yes, it changes your voice tone!)
5. **If you mess up**, pause 3 seconds, then restart the sentence (edit later)
6. **Don't apologize** on camera ("Sorry, um, let me try again..." - just pause and redo)
7. **Energy level**: You're showing off something you built! Be proud!
