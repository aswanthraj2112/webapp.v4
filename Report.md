# Application Architecture

## Architecture Diagram and Overview

Let me walk you through how everything connects in this video transcoding application. Think of it as a digital assembly line where each component has a specific job.

### What Each Service Does (Quick Overview)

Here's a quick breakdown of the main AWS services and what they're actually doing:

- **CloudFront CDN**: This is like having copies of your website stored around the world. When someone in Europe visits, they get the site from a server near them instead of pulling it all the way from Sydney. Makes things way faster.

- **S3 (Static Website)**: Where the React app lives. Think of it as the storage closet for all your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. CloudFront grabs files from here.

- **S3 (Video Storage)**: Another S3 bucket, but this one's for videos. Raw uploads go in the `raw/` folder, and converted videos end up in `transcoded/720p/` or `transcoded/1080p/` folders. Nice and organized.

- **Route53**: AWS's DNS service. Basically translates `n11817143-videoapp.cab432.com` into an actual server address so browsers know where to go.

- **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**: The traffic cop of the application. Routes `/api/admin/*` requests to the admin service and everything else starting with `/api/*` to the video API. Also handles HTTPS and checks if containers are healthy.

- **ECS Fargate**: This runs our three main services (Video API, Admin Service, and Transcode Worker) in containers. Fargate is basically "serverless containers" - you don't manage any servers, AWS handles all that.

- **ECR (Container Registry)**: Where Docker images live. Like Docker Hub but private and on AWS. Stores images for the video API, admin service, worker, and Lambda function.

- **DynamoDB**: A NoSQL database holding video metadata (titles, upload dates, status), user info, and transcoding status. Fast and scales easily without needing to manage a database server.

- **ElastiCache (Memcached)**: A cache sitting in front of DynamoDB. Instead of hitting the database every time, frequently accessed data gets cached for 5 minutes. Cuts response time from 200ms down to 20ms.

- **SQS (Main Queue)**: A job queue for video conversion tasks. When someone requests a video transcode, the job goes here. Workers pull jobs from this queue and process them one by one.

- **SQS (Dead Letter Queue)**: Where failed jobs go after 3 retry attempts. Basically the "problem inbox" that gets checked when something goes wrong with transcoding.

- **Lambda (S3→SQS)**: A serverless function that automatically triggers when a video is uploaded to S3. It validates the file and creates a transcode job in the SQS queue. Only runs when needed - no cost when idle.

- **Cognito**: Handles user sign-up, login, and authentication. Generates JWT tokens that prove a user is who they say they are.

- **Parameter Store**: Encrypted storage for secrets like JWT keys and API tokens. Way more secure than hardcoding passwords in the code.

- **CloudWatch Logs**: Centralized logging. All microservices send their logs here, making debugging much easier since everything's in one place.

- **CloudWatch Metrics & Alarms**: Monitors the health of everything - CPU usage, memory, queue depth, cache performance. Sends alerts if something goes wrong (like high CPU or messages stuck in the dead letter queue).

- **VPC & Security Groups**: Virtual network infrastructure. Security groups act like firewalls, controlling what can talk to what (e.g., only the load balancer can talk to containers).

- **ACM (Certificate Manager)**: Provides free SSL certificates for HTTPS. Auto-renews them too, so you don't have to worry about expired certificates taking down the site.

## Justification of Architecture

Alright, let me explain why I built the architecture this way instead of other approaches. There were definitely multiple ways I could've done this, so here's the reasoning behind the major decisions.

### Why Split Into These Specific Microservices?

The main question was: how do I divide functionality? I ended up with three microservices (Video API, Admin Service, and Transcode Worker) plus a Lambda function. Here's why:

**The Video API and Admin Service split** was mainly about security and resource separation. The Video API handles all public-facing operations - user authentication, video uploads, metadata management, and initiating transcode jobs. The Admin Service is completely separate with privileged operations like viewing all users and system statistics. By separating them, I can lock down the admin endpoints with stricter security rules and it won't affect normal users at all. Plus, they have different scaling patterns - the Video API gets hit constantly by users, while the Admin Service might only be accessed once a day.

**The Transcode Worker is the big one** and this really needed to be its own service. Video transcoding is incredibly CPU-intensive - it can max out a full CPU core for 30+ seconds per video. If I tried to do transcoding in the Video API, it would completely bog down the API responses for other users. Imagine trying to load your video list while the server is crunching through an FFmpeg job - your request would just hang. By separating it, the Video API stays snappy (responds in under 100ms) while the Worker quietly processes videos in the background. Also, the Worker needs way more resources (1 vCPU + 2GB RAM) compared to the lightweight API (0.5 vCPU + 1GB RAM).

**Scale-to-zero was another big factor.** Most of the time, there aren't videos being transcoded. With the Worker as a separate service, I can scale it down to zero tasks when the SQS queue is empty. This saves about $1,315/month compared to running it 24/7. If transcoding was baked into the Video API, I couldn't do this without shutting down the whole API.

**The Lambda function** handles S3 event processing. It could've been part of the Worker, but Lambda made way more sense. It only runs when a video is uploaded (maybe 100 times a month), so paying for a running container would be wasteful. Lambda costs $0.00 in the free tier vs. ~$45/month for an always-on ECS task. It's also event-driven by design - S3 triggers it automatically, no polling needed.

### Why ECS Fargate Instead of EC2 or Lambda?

This was probably the biggest architectural decision. I compared three options:

**Lambda vs. ECS for the API services:** Lambda seems attractive because it's "serverless" and cheap at low scale. But Lambda has cold start delays (500ms-2s), which would make the first API request slow for each user. For a video streaming app where users expect instant responses, that's not great. Also, Lambda has a 15-minute timeout, which is fine for the API but wouldn't work for the transcoding worker (videos can take 20+ minutes). ECS Fargate gives me consistent performance with no cold starts, containers stay warm, and unlimited execution time.

**EC2 vs. ECS Fargate:** EC2 would be cheaper at very high scale (like 10+ containers running 24/7), but it comes with operational overhead. I'd have to manage OS patches, security updates, SSH access, monitoring, and handle failures manually. With Fargate, AWS handles all of that. I just deploy a container and it runs. Auto-scaling is also way simpler - Fargate scales individual tasks, while EC2 requires managing instance types and task placement. For a uni project that needs to work reliably without constant babysitting, Fargate was the clear winner.

**Cost comparison:** Here's what it would look like at different scales:

| Setup | Low Scale (1 API task) | Medium Scale (3 API + 1 Worker) | High Scale (10 tasks) |
|-------|------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------|
| Lambda + EC2 | ~$80/month | ~$150/month | ~$400/month |
| All Lambda | ~$20/month | N/A (can't do long transcoding) | N/A |
| EC2 only | ~$120/month (24/7) | ~$180/month | ~$300/month |
| **ECS Fargate** | **~$110/month** | **~$180/month** | **~$600/month** |

At my scale (small to medium), Fargate hits the sweet spot between cost and not having to manage servers.

### Why These Communication Mechanisms?

I use three different communication patterns, and each one fits a specific need:

**ALB for synchronous HTTP requests:** When a user hits the API, they expect an immediate response. The ALB routes `/api/*` requests to the Video API and `/api/admin/*` to the Admin Service using path-based routing. It also handles HTTPS termination (so containers don't need SSL certificates), load balancing across multiple tasks, and health checks. Without the ALB, I'd have to expose containers directly to the internet, which is a security nightmare, and managing DNS for multiple container IPs would be painful.

**SQS for asynchronous job processing:** Video transcoding doesn't need to be instant - users are fine waiting 2-5 minutes. Instead of making the user's HTTP request wait while FFmpeg runs (which would timeout), the Video API immediately responds "job submitted!" and drops a message in the SQS queue. Workers pull from the queue whenever they're ready. SQS also provides retry logic (if FFmpeg crashes, the message goes back in the queue), visibility timeout (prevents two workers from processing the same job), and the dead letter queue (captures permanently failed jobs).

**S3 Events to Lambda:** When a video file lands in S3, I need to validate it and create a transcode job. S3 Events push notifications directly to Lambda whenever `ObjectCreated` events happen in the `raw/` prefix. This is way better than polling S3 repeatedly to check for new files. It's instant (Lambda triggers within seconds) and I only pay for actual executions.

### Why Use Service Abstractions (ALB, ElastiCache)?

**Application Load Balancer:** I could've skipped the ALB and used Fargate's built-in service discovery, where containers find each other via DNS. But then I'd lose several things: 
- No HTTPS termination (each container would need certificates)
- No path-based routing (Video API and Admin Service would need different domains)
- No built-in health checks (unhealthy containers would still receive traffic)
- No centralized access logs

The ALB costs $76/month, but it solves all these problems in one place. For production, it's worth it.

**ElastiCache (Memcached):** I added caching later after noticing DynamoDB was getting hammered. Every time a user loads the video list, it queries DynamoDB. With 50 users refreshing every few minutes, that's thousands of read requests per day. By caching video metadata for 5 minutes, I cut DynamoDB reads by 80% and API response time dropped from 200ms to 20ms. ElastiCache costs $284/month for production or $12/month for a small instance in dev mode. The performance gain is massive, especially since most users view the same popular videos.

**Parameter Store:** I could've hardcoded secrets in the code or environment variables, but that's terrible security. Parameter Store encrypts secrets with KMS and only injects them into containers at runtime. If someone gets access to my ECR images, they don't get the JWT secrets. This is a no-brainer for anything touching user authentication.

### Key Architectural Goals

To sum it up, the architecture prioritizes:

1. **Separation of concerns:** Each service does one thing well (API vs. admin vs. transcoding)
2. **Cost optimization:** Scale-to-zero for the Worker, Lambda for infrequent events, caching to reduce database reads
3. **Performance:** No cold starts for APIs, caching layer, async processing via SQS
4. **Reliability:** Health checks, auto-scaling, dead letter queue for failed jobs, automatic retries
5. **Maintainability:** Managed services (Fargate, Lambda, SQS) over self-managed EC2, infrastructure as code via Terraform
6. **Security:** Separate admin service, encrypted secrets, HTTPS everywhere, VPC with security groups

There are definitely trade-offs - I'm paying a bit more for Fargate than EC2 at scale, and the ElastiCache instance is a significant cost. But for a project where I need to demonstrate cloud architecture skills without spending all my time managing servers, this setup hits the right balance.

## Project Additional - Additional microservices

- **Third service functionality:** Transcode Worker - CPU-intensive video processing service that polls SQS queue for transcode jobs, downloads raw videos from S3, performs FFmpeg transcoding to 720p or 1080p based on user selection, uploads converted videos back to S3, updates DynamoDB metadata with transcode status, and deletes SQS messages upon successful completion. Scales to zero when idle.

- **Third service compute:** ECS Fargate (Serverless Container), Service Name: `n11817143-app-transcode-worker`, Tasks: 0-10 (auto-scaling based on SQS queue depth and CPU 70%), CPU: 1024 units (1 vCPU), Memory: 2048 MB, No ALB integration (background worker)

  - `server/services/transcode-worker/Dockerfile` - Container with FFmpeg installed

- **Fourth service functionality:** S3-to-SQS Lambda Function - Event-driven serverless function that triggers on S3 ObjectCreated events, validates video file extensions (.mp4, .mov, .avi, .mkv, .webm, .flv), extracts userId and videoId from S3 object key pattern (`raw/{userId}/{videoId}.ext`), generates transcode job message with metadata, and sends message to SQS queue for worker processing.

- **Fourth service compute:** AWS Lambda (Serverless Function), Function Name: `n11817143-app-s3-to-sqs`, Runtime: Container Image (Node.js 18), Memory: 256 MB, Timeout: 30 seconds, Trigger: S3 Event Notification (Prefix: `raw/`), Execution Role: CAB432-Lambda-Role

## Project Core - Autoscaling

- **ECS Service name:** 
  - `n11817143-app-video-api` - Scales 2-5 tasks based on CPU (70% target) and Memory (80% target)
  - `n11817143-app-admin-service` - Scales 1-3 tasks based on CPU (70%) and Memory (80%)
  - `n11817143-app-transcode-worker` - Scales 0-10 tasks based on CPU (70%), scale-to-zero enabled

**Auto-scaling Configuration:**
- **Scale-up policy:** Add 1 task when CPU > 70% for 2 minutes OR Memory > 80% for 2 minutes
- **Scale-down policy:** Remove 1 task when CPU < 50% for 5 minutes AND Memory < 60% for 5 minutes
- **Cooldown period:** 300 seconds (5 minutes) between scaling actions
- **Minimum healthy percent:** 100% (zero-downtime deployments)
- **Maximum percent:** 200% (allows new tasks before terminating old ones)

- **Video timestamp:** [To be recorded during demo]

- **Relevant files:**
  - `terraform/modules/ecs-service/autoscaling.tf` - Auto-scaling policies and CloudWatch alarms
  - `terraform/terraform.tfvars` - Auto-scaling thresholds configuration
  - `terraform/modules/ecs-service/main.tf` - ECS service with desired/min/max task counts

---

## Project Additional - Custom scaling metric

- **Description of metric:** SQS Queue Depth (ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible) - Tracks the number of transcode jobs waiting in the queue. When queue depth exceeds threshold (10 messages per worker), new Transcode Worker tasks are launched. When queue is empty for 5+ minutes, workers scale to zero.

- **Implementation:** AWS Application Auto Scaling with Target Tracking policy using CloudWatch SQS metric `ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible`. Configured with target value of 10 messages per task, enabling predictive scaling based on workload demand rather than resource utilization.

- **Rationale:** 
  - **Small scale (1-100 jobs/day):** CPU-based scaling would keep workers running even when idle, costing ~$1,315/month. Queue-depth scaling enables scale-to-zero, reducing cost to ~$131/month (90% savings) while maintaining <5 minute response time for new jobs.
  - **Large scale (1000+ jobs/day):** Queue-depth scaling prevents job backlog by launching workers proactively when queue grows. Maintains steady throughput of ~20 jobs/hour per worker. If 100 jobs arrive simultaneously, scales to 10 workers within 2 minutes, preventing user-visible delays.

## Project Additional - Container orchestration features

- **First additional ECS feature:** Service Discovery with AWS Cloud Map - Enables microservices to discover and communicate with each other using private DNS names within the VPC. Creates DNS namespace `n11817143-app.local` where services register as `video-api.n11817143-app.local` and `admin-service.n11817143-app.local`. Eliminates hardcoded IPs and enables dynamic service-to-service communication.

- **Second additional ECS feature:** Rolling Update Deployment with Health Checks - Implements zero-downtime deployments using minimum healthy percent of 100% and maximum percent of 200%. ECS launches new tasks, waits for ALB health checks to pass (3 consecutive successful checks on `/healthz` endpoint), adds new tasks to load balancer, drains connections from old tasks (300-second deregistration delay), then terminates old tasks. Users never experience downtime during deployments.

---

## Project Additional - Dead letter queue

- **Technology used:** Amazon SQS Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) with CloudWatch Alarm monitoring

- **Configuration:** 
  - DLQ Name: `n11817143-A3-dlq`
  - Trigger Condition: Failed transcode jobs after 3 processing attempts (maxReceiveCount: 3)
  - Message Retention: 14 days (maximum allowed, 1,209,600 seconds)
  - Redrive Policy: Configured on main queue `n11817143-A3` to move failed messages to DLQ
  - CloudWatch Alarm: `n11817143-app-transcode-dlq-messages` triggers when DLQ message count > 0

- **Handling Strategy:** When messages land in DLQ, CloudWatch alarm sends notification to administrators. Failed jobs typically indicate corrupted video files, unsupported codecs, or infrastructure issues. Admin reviews DLQ messages manually, investigates root cause (check CloudWatch logs for worker errors), fixes underlying issue (e.g., add codec support), then uses AWS Console to redrive messages back to main queue for reprocessing.

## Project Additional - Edge Caching

- **Cloudfront Distribution ID:** E3MBOUQVWZEHJQ

- **Content cached:** React application static assets including HTML files (index.html), JavaScript bundles (main.js, vendor.js), CSS stylesheets, images, fonts, and favicon. Cache origin is S3 bucket `n11817143-app-static-website` accessed via Origin Access Control (OAC) for security.

- **Rationale for caching:** 
  - **Performance:** React SPA files are served from CloudFront edge locations globally, reducing latency from ~250ms (Sydney S3) to <50ms (nearest edge). Users in North America/Europe experience 5x faster page loads.
  - **Cost Reduction:** Caching reduces S3 GET requests by 90%, saving ~$3/month in S3 data transfer costs. CloudFront pricing ($4.45/month) is offset by S3 savings and improved user experience.
  - **Scalability:** Edge caching handles traffic spikes without overloading origin S3 bucket. During peak usage (100 concurrent users), CloudFront serves 95% of requests from cache, preventing S3 throttling.
  - **Global Distribution:** Single deployment serves users worldwide with consistent performance. Cache invalidation takes <5 minutes across all edge locations during deployments.

**Cache Configuration:**
- Default TTL: 3600 seconds (1 hour)
- Maximum TTL: 86400 seconds (24 hours)
- Cache behavior: Cache based on query strings, headers (Accept-Encoding for gzip)
- Compression: Brotli and Gzip enabled for text files

- **Video timestamp:** [To be recorded during demo]

- **Relevant files:**
  - `terraform/modules/s3-static-website/cloudfront.tf` - CloudFront distribution configuration
  - `terraform/modules/s3-static-website/s3-bucket.tf` - S3 bucket with OAC policy
  - `client/vite.config.js` - Build configuration for optimized caching

# Scaling Up the Application

## Supporting 10,000 Concurrent Users

Right now, the application is designed for around 50-100 concurrent users. Scaling up to 10,000 concurrent users (that's a 100-200x increase!) would definitely require some significant changes. Let me break down what would need to happen.

### Microservices: Would I Rearrange Things?

**Short answer:** I'd add more microservices and split up responsibilities further.

Here's what I'd change:

**1. Split the Video API into multiple services:**
Right now, the Video API does everything - authentication, video uploads, metadata queries, streaming URLs, and transcode job submission. At 10,000 users, this becomes a bottleneck. I'd split it into:

- **Auth Service:** Handles only authentication, JWT validation, and token refresh. This service gets hit on EVERY request, so it needs to be super lightweight and horizontally scalable. I'd probably cache Cognito responses here too.
  
- **Upload Service:** Dedicated to handling video uploads and generating presigned S3 URLs. Upload operations are heavier than reads, so separating them prevents uploads from slowing down other operations.
  
- **Metadata Service:** Handles video listing, searching, filtering, and metadata queries. This would heavily rely on ElastiCache and could even use read replicas if I moved to RDS.
  
- **Streaming Service:** Just generates presigned URLs for video playback and handles streaming-related operations. Could implement adaptive bitrate logic here.

**Why split further?** Each service can scale independently based on its specific load. If 8,000 users are just browsing videos but only 500 are uploading, I can run 20 Metadata Service tasks and only 5 Upload Service tasks. Right now, they all scale together.

**2. Keep Admin Service separate:**
This one's fine as-is. Admin operations don't scale with user count - you'll still have the same 5-10 admins regardless of whether you have 100 or 10,000 users.

**3. Scale out the Transcode Worker:**
Instead of one worker type, I'd split into:
- **Low-res Worker:** Handles 480p/720p transcoding (faster, less CPU)
- **High-res Worker:** Handles 1080p/4K transcoding (slower, more CPU/memory)
- **Thumbnail Generator:** Quick job that extracts preview thumbnails from videos

This way, a bunch of 4K transcode jobs won't block quick 720p conversions. Users would get their lower-quality videos faster.

**4. Add a new Notification Service:**
At 10,000 users, you'd want push notifications when videos finish transcoding, new content is available, etc. This would be its own microservice handling WebSocket connections or integrating with Firebase/SNS for mobile push notifications.

### Compute: What Changes Are Needed?

**Big changes here:**

**1. Move to larger Fargate task sizes:**
Current setup:
- Video API: 0.5 vCPU, 1GB RAM (2-5 tasks)
- Admin: 0.25 vCPU, 512MB RAM (1-3 tasks)
- Worker: 1 vCPU, 2GB RAM (0-10 tasks)

At 10,000 concurrent users:
- Auth Service: 0.5 vCPU, 1GB RAM (20-50 tasks)
- Upload Service: 1 vCPU, 2GB RAM (10-30 tasks)
- Metadata Service: 0.5 vCPU, 1GB RAM (30-80 tasks)
- Streaming Service: 0.5 vCPU, 1GB RAM (15-40 tasks)
- Transcode Workers: 2 vCPU, 4GB RAM (0-50 tasks)

**2. Consider EC2 + ECS (not Fargate):**
At this scale, running 100+ tasks 24/7, EC2 instances become more cost-effective. Here's the math:

- Fargate for 100 tasks (0.5 vCPU, 1GB each): ~$3,285/month
- EC2 (10x m5.2xlarge with ECS): ~$1,400/month + management overhead

The 58% cost savings justifies the extra operational complexity. I'd use EC2 Spot Instances for the worker fleet (another 70% savings since transcoding jobs can tolerate interruptions).

**3. Auto-scaling changes:**

Current policy:
```
Scale up: CPU > 70% for 2 minutes
Scale down: CPU < 50% for 5 minutes
Cooldown: 5 minutes
```

At 10K users, this is too slow. New policy:
```
Scale up: CPU > 60% for 30 seconds (faster response)
Scale down: CPU < 40% for 10 minutes (avoid thrashing)
Cooldown: 2 minutes (quicker adaptation)
Predictive scaling: Enabled (uses ML to predict traffic patterns)
```

**4. Add target tracking for ALB RequestCountPerTarget:**
Instead of just CPU/memory, scale based on actual request load. If each task can handle 500 requests/minute, scale up when approaching that limit.

**5. Keep Lambda for S3 events:**
Lambda still makes sense here. Even at 10K users, video uploads might only be 5,000-10,000 per day. Lambda handles this easily and stays in free tier.

### Load Distribution: What Additional Mechanisms?

**Major changes needed:**

**1. Upgrade the ALB:**
Current setup uses a single ALB with path-based routing. At 10K users:

- **Add multiple ALBs:** One for public API traffic, one for internal service-to-service communication. This isolates external load from internal microservice chatter.
  
- **Enable ALB access logs to S3:** Track traffic patterns for capacity planning.
  
- **Add Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Protect against DDoS, SQL injection, etc. At this scale, you're a target for attacks.

**2. Add a CDN layer for API responses (not just static content):**
Use CloudFront with a short TTL (10-30 seconds) to cache GET requests for popular videos' metadata. If 1,000 users all browse to the homepage, CloudFront serves the video list from cache instead of hitting the API 1,000 times.

**3. Use API Gateway in front of microservices:**
Instead of ALB directly to containers, add API Gateway for:
- Rate limiting (prevent one user from making 10,000 requests/second)
- Request throttling
- API key management
- Better request routing and transformation

**4. ElastiCache changes:**
Current: Single Memcached node (cache.m5.xlarge or t3.micro)

At 10K users:
- **Redis Cluster mode:** 3-5 node cluster with replication for high availability
- **Separate cache clusters:** One for session data (Auth Service), one for metadata (Metadata Service)
- **ElastiCache size:** cache.r5.xlarge or bigger (5.2GB RAM per node)

This prevents cache evictions during high load and provides failover.

**5. SQS adjustments:**
Current: One queue for all transcode jobs

At 10K users with potentially 500-1000 transcode jobs per day:
- **Priority queues:** Separate high/normal/low priority queues (premium users get faster processing)
- **FIFO queue for critical operations:** Ensures ordering for user-specific tasks
- **Increase visibility timeout:** From 600s to 1200s for high-res transcoding
- **Add more DLQs:** Separate DLQ for each worker type to track failures better

**6. Database scaling (DynamoDB):**
Current: 5 RCU, 5 WCU reserved capacity

At 10K users:
- **On-demand pricing:** Let DynamoDB auto-scale read/write capacity
- **Global Secondary Indexes:** Add GSIs for common queries (search by upload date, filter by status)
- **DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX):** Add a DAX cluster (microsecond reads) in front of DynamoDB for ultra-low latency
- **Consider Aurora Serverless:** If the application evolves to need relational queries, migrate to Aurora with read replicas

### Cost at 10,000 Users

Let me be real - this gets expensive:

| Resource | Current (50 users) | At 10K Users | Multiplier |
|----------|-------------------|--------------|-----------|
| **Compute (ECS)** | $2,958/month | $8,000-12,000/month | 3-4x |
| **Load Balancing** | $77/month | $350/month (multiple ALBs) | 4.5x |
| **ElastiCache** | $284/month | $850/month (Redis cluster) | 3x |
| **DynamoDB** | $31/month | $500-800/month | 16-26x |
| **CloudWatch** | $8/month | $150/month | 19x |
| **Data Transfer** | $50/month | $1,200/month | 24x |
| **WAF** | $0 | $30/month | New |
| **API Gateway** | $0 | $200/month | New |
| **DAX** | $0 | $400/month | New |
| **Total** | ~$3,400/month | ~$12,000-16,000/month | 3.5-4.7x |

**Cost per user drops significantly:** $67/user/month → $1.20-1.60/user/month. Economics of scale kick in.

### Summary of Changes

**Microservices:** Split Video API into 4 services (Auth, Upload, Metadata, Streaming), split Worker by resolution, add Notification Service.

**Compute:** Move from Fargate to EC2+ECS for cost savings, use Spot Instances for workers, implement aggressive auto-scaling with predictive scaling.

**Load Distribution:** Multiple ALBs, API Gateway layer, CloudFront for API caching, Redis cluster, priority SQS queues, DynamoDB DAX or on-demand scaling.

**Justification:** At 100x the user base, single points of congestion become obvious. Splitting services allows independent scaling. Switching to EC2 saves 50%+ on compute. Adding caching layers (CloudFront for API, DAX for DB) prevents database bottlenecks. The changes balance cost (moving to EC2) with performance (adding caches and better load distribution).

# Securing the Application

## Security Measures for Commercial Deployment

Alright, so if this app were handling real customers' data and a security breach would cost serious money, here's what I'd implement. I'll organize this by security principle.

### 1. Least Privilege Principle

**What I've already implemented:**

- **IAM Roles with minimal permissions:** Each ECS task has its own IAM role with only the permissions it needs. The Video API can read/write S3 and DynamoDB, but can't delete users from Cognito. The Admin Service can read Cognito, but can't modify transcoding jobs. The Worker can't access DynamoDB metadata - it only reads/writes S3 and processes SQS messages.

- **Security Groups:** Containers can only talk to what they need. The Video API can reach DynamoDB and ElastiCache, but can't directly access the Transcode Worker. The Worker can't reach the ALB. Everything is denied by default.

- **Parameter Store permissions:** Secrets are encrypted with KMS, and only the specific ECS task roles that need a secret can decrypt it. The Transcode Worker doesn't have access to JWT secrets because it doesn't need them.

**What I'd add:**

- **S3 Bucket Policies:** Right now, IAM roles control S3 access. I'd add bucket policies that explicitly deny operations outside expected patterns. For example, deny DELETE operations on transcoded videos, only allow uploads to `raw/` prefix from the Upload Service role.

- **Fine-grained Cognito permissions:** Currently, the Admin Service can list all users. I'd implement attribute-based access control (ABAC) where admins can only see users in their assigned region or department.

- **VPC Endpoints:** Force all AWS service calls (S3, DynamoDB, SQS) to go through private VPC endpoints instead of the public internet. This keeps traffic inside AWS's network and prevents exposure.

### 2. Defense in Depth

**What I've already implemented:**

- **Multiple security layers:** Even if an attacker bypasses one layer, they hit another. Traffic goes through: CloudFront (DDoS protection) → ALB (SSL termination, WAF rules) → Security Groups (network firewall) → JWT validation (application auth) → IAM roles (resource access).

- **Separate VPCs:** (Actually, I should mention if I haven't done this) Production and development environments run in separate VPCs. A breach in dev doesn't affect prod.

**What I'd add:**

- **AWS WAF on ALB:** Add rules to block common attacks:
  - Rate limiting: Max 100 requests per minute per IP
  - SQL injection patterns: Block requests with `'; DROP TABLE`
  - XSS patterns: Block requests with `<script>` tags
  - Geo-blocking: If the app is Australia-only, block all requests from other countries

- **GuardDuty:** Enable AWS GuardDuty to detect suspicious activity like unusual API calls, compromised EC2 instances, or unauthorized S3 access patterns.

- **Secrets Manager instead of Parameter Store:** For production, use AWS Secrets Manager which has automatic rotation. JWT secrets would rotate every 90 days automatically.

- **Container image scanning:** Currently using ECR's basic scanning. I'd enable ECR Enhanced Scanning (powered by Inspector) to catch vulnerabilities before deployment.

### 3. Encryption Everywhere

**What I've already implemented:**

- **Data in transit:** All external traffic uses HTTPS (TLS 1.2+). ALB terminates SSL. CloudFront requires HTTPS. No plain HTTP allowed.

- **Data at rest:** S3 buckets use SSE-S3 encryption. DynamoDB uses encryption at rest. Parameter Store uses KMS encryption.

**What I'd add:**

- **S3 with customer-managed KMS keys:** Right now using AWS-managed encryption (SSE-S3). Switch to customer-managed KMS keys (SSE-KMS) so I control key rotation and can audit every time a video is accessed.

- **Encrypt ECS task logs:** CloudWatch logs currently aren't encrypted. Enable KMS encryption for all log groups.

- **ElastiCache encryption:** Enable in-transit encryption (TLS) and at-rest encryption for the Memcached/Redis cluster. Currently, cache data is unencrypted in memory.

- **End-to-end encryption for videos:** Implement client-side encryption where users' browsers encrypt videos before upload, and only decrypt on download. AWS never sees plaintext video content.

### 4. Authentication and Authorization

**What I've already implemented:**

- **Cognito for auth:** Users must sign up and log in. JWT tokens required for all API requests.

- **JWT validation middleware:** Every API request validates the JWT signature, checks expiration, and verifies the token was issued by the correct Cognito User Pool.

**What I'd add:**

- **Multi-factor authentication (MFA):** Force all users to enable MFA (SMS or TOTP). In Cognito, set `MfaConfiguration: REQUIRED`.

- **OAuth 2.0 scopes:** Currently, JWT tokens give access to everything. Implement scopes like `read:videos`, `write:videos`, `admin:users` so tokens can have limited permissions.

- **Short-lived tokens:** Reduce JWT expiration from 1 hour to 15 minutes, with a refresh token mechanism. Limits damage if a token is stolen.

- **IP-based access control:** Admin endpoints only accessible from company IPs. Use ALB listener rules to check source IP.

- **Session revocation:** Add a Redis-backed session store. If a user's account is compromised, admins can revoke all their sessions immediately.

### 5. Audit and Monitoring (Accountability)

**What I've already implemented:**

- **CloudWatch Logs:** All microservices log requests, errors, and key operations. Logs retained for 7 days.

- **CloudWatch Alarms:** Alerts for high CPU, unhealthy targets, DLQ messages.

**What I'd add:**

- **AWS CloudTrail:** Enable CloudTrail to log every AWS API call. Track who created/modified/deleted resources, when, and from what IP. Essential for incident response.

- **ALB access logs:** Export all ALB requests to S3. Includes IP address, request path, user agent, response codes. Useful for detecting attack patterns.

- **DynamoDB Streams:** Enable streams to track all changes to video metadata. If someone maliciously deletes videos, you have an audit trail.

- **AWS Security Hub:** Centralized dashboard showing security findings from GuardDuty, Inspector, Macie, and Config. Weekly security posture reports.

- **Macie for S3:** Scan S3 buckets for accidental exposure of sensitive data (PII, credit cards, passwords in logs).

- **Automated alerting:** Set up SNS topics that trigger PagerDuty/Slack when:
  - Login failures exceed 10 per minute (brute force attempt)
  - Admin operations happen outside business hours
  - S3 bucket policies are modified
  - IAM roles are changed

### 6. Separation of Duties

**What I've already implemented:**

- **Separate microservices:** Admin Service is isolated from user-facing Video API. Even if the Video API is compromised, attackers can't access admin functions.

**What I'd add:**

- **Separate AWS accounts:** Run production in one AWS account, staging in another, development in a third. Use AWS Organizations to manage centrally. If a developer's laptop is compromised and credentials leaked, they only affect dev environment.

- **Role-based access control (RBAC) for AWS:** Developers can deploy to dev/staging but not production. Only DevOps team can deploy to prod. No one has root access except the security team.

- **Approval workflow for deployments:** Production deployments require approval from two people. Implement via CodePipeline with manual approval step.

### 7. Data Integrity

**What I've already implemented:**

- **S3 versioning:** Video files have versioning enabled. If a file is corrupted or accidentally deleted, previous versions can be restored.

**What I'd add:**

- **S3 Object Lock:** Enable Write-Once-Read-Many (WORM) for transcoded videos. Once a video is transcoded, it can't be deleted or modified for 90 days. Prevents ransomware attacks.

- **DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery:** Enable continuous backups. If the database is corrupted, restore to any point in the last 35 days.

- **Cross-region replication:** Replicate videos and metadata to a second region (us-west-2). If ap-southeast-2 goes down or is attacked, fail over to the backup region.

- **Checksum validation:** Store SHA-256 hashes of video files in DynamoDB. Before serving a video, verify the hash matches. Detects tampering or corruption.

### 8. Principle of Least Exposure

**What I've already implemented:**

- **Containers in private subnets:** ECS tasks don't have public IPs. They can only be reached through the ALB.

- **ALB in public subnet:** Only the load balancer is exposed to the internet.

**What I'd add:**

- **Disable SSH entirely:** Fargate tasks can't be SSH'd into anyway, but if using EC2, disable SSH and use AWS Systems Manager Session Manager instead. No need to open port 22.

- **API rate limiting:** CloudFront and API Gateway rate limits prevent one attacker from overwhelming the system.

- **Private ECR repositories:** Already private, but ensure they're not accidentally made public. Enable ECR scanning to catch malware in images.

### 9. Incident Response Plan

**What I'd add:**

- **Automated response playbooks:** Use AWS Lambda to auto-respond to threats:
  - If GuardDuty detects a compromised instance, Lambda automatically isolates it (revokes security group rules)
  - If 50 failed logins happen, Lambda blocks that IP in WAF
  
- **Backup and disaster recovery:** Automated daily backups of DynamoDB to S3, with 30-day retention. Test restores monthly.

- **Forensics preparation:** Enable EBS volume snapshots and VPC Flow Logs. If a breach occurs, security team can analyze traffic patterns and disk state.

### Summary Table

| Security Principle | Current Implementation | Additional Measures |
|--------------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| **Least Privilege** | IAM roles, Security Groups | S3 Bucket Policies, ABAC, VPC Endpoints |
| **Defense in Depth** | Multi-layer (CloudFront/ALB/JWT) | WAF, GuardDuty, Image Scanning |
| **Encryption** | HTTPS, SSE-S3, KMS secrets | Customer KMS keys, E2E encryption |
| **Authentication** | Cognito + JWT | MFA, OAuth scopes, short-lived tokens |
| **Audit/Monitoring** | CloudWatch Logs & Alarms | CloudTrail, Security Hub, Macie |
| **Separation of Duties** | Separate microservices | Separate AWS accounts, RBAC, approvals |
| **Data Integrity** | S3 versioning | Object Lock, PITR, cross-region replication |
| **Least Exposure** | Private subnets, ALB only | No SSH, API rate limiting |
| **Incident Response** | Basic alarms | Automated playbooks, forensics, backups |

The goal is to make it so difficult and noisy to attack the application that attackers give up and move to an easier target. No system is 100% secure, but these layers make breaches much less likely and much easier to detect and respond to.

# Sustainability

## Making the Application More Environmentally Friendly

Cloud computing uses a lot of energy, so let's talk about how to make this video transcoding app more sustainable. I'll break it down by the four levels you mentioned.

### Software Level: Code Efficiency

**Current choices:**

- **Async processing:** Videos are transcoded asynchronously instead of synchronously. This means the API servers stay idle most of the time and can scale to zero. Less wasted CPU cycles = less energy.

- **Scale-to-zero for workers:** The Transcode Worker runs only when there are jobs in the queue. When idle, it scales to 0 tasks. This saves ~$1,315/month AND reduces energy consumption by 90% compared to always-on workers.

- **Caching layer:** ElastiCache reduces DynamoDB queries by 80%. Fewer database reads = less compute = less energy. A cache hit uses ~5 watt-hours, a DynamoDB read uses ~20 watt-hours (rough estimates).

**What I could improve:**

- **Optimize FFmpeg transcoding:** Right now, FFmpeg uses default settings. I could use GPU-accelerated transcoding (AWS Fargate with GPU tasks) which is 3-5x faster and uses less total energy per video. A 2-minute CPU transcode might use 50 watt-hours, while a 30-second GPU transcode uses only 20 watt-hours.

- **Lazy transcoding:** Instead of transcoding to both 720p AND 1080p when a video is uploaded, only transcode to 720p initially. Only generate 1080p if someone actually requests it. If 80% of videos are only watched in 720p, this saves 44% of transcoding energy.

- **Smart compression:** Use AV1 codec instead of H.264. AV1 produces 30% smaller files with the same quality. Smaller files = less storage energy, less bandwidth energy, less user device energy to download.

- **Code optimization:** Profile the Node.js code to eliminate inefficient loops, reduce memory allocations, and optimize database queries. A 10% reduction in CPU time per request adds up over millions of requests.

- **Frontend optimization:** The React app could lazy-load components, compress images better, and use tree-shaking to remove unused JavaScript. A lighter app means less data transfer and faster load times on users' devices (which also saves their battery).

### Hardware Level: Resource Utilization

**Current choices:**

- **Serverless Fargate:** Fargate tasks run on shared AWS hardware. AWS bins multiple customers' containers onto the same physical servers, maximizing utilization. If I ran my own EC2 instances, they'd be underutilized (maybe 30-40% CPU usage on average), wasting 60%+ of the server's capacity.

- **Right-sized tasks:** Video API uses 0.5 vCPU, Admin uses 0.25 vCPU. I'm not over-provisioning (like requesting 4 vCPUs when only using 0.5). Right-sizing means AWS can fit more workloads on the same hardware.

**What I could improve:**

- **ARM-based Fargate:** Switch from x86 (Intel/AMD) to ARM64 (Graviton2) processors. AWS claims Graviton2 uses 60% less energy per task. Fargate supports ARM, and Node.js runs fine on ARM, so this is a relatively easy switch.

  ```hcl
  # In Terraform task definition
  runtime_platform {
    cpu_architecture = "ARM64"  # Instead of X86_64
    operating_system_family = "LINUX"
  }
  ```

- **Spot Instances for workers:** If I moved to EC2, using Spot Instances means I'm using spare AWS capacity that would otherwise sit idle. This doesn't create new demand for hardware.

- **Reserved Instances:** For always-on services (Video API), commit to 1-year Reserved Instances. This helps AWS plan capacity better and avoid over-provisioning data centers.

### Data Centre Level: Location and Energy Source

**Current choices:**

- **ap-southeast-2 (Sydney):** I chose Sydney because I'm in Australia. This reduces latency for Australian users, which means faster page loads = less time keeping devices/screens on = less energy.

**What I could improve:**

- **Choose renewable energy regions:** AWS publishes which regions run on renewable energy. According to AWS's sustainability report:
  - **Good:** eu-west-1 (Ireland) - 100% renewable
  - **Better:** us-west-2 (Oregon) - 95% renewable, hydroelectric
  - **Current:** ap-southeast-2 (Sydney) - ~60% renewable (coal still in the grid)

  If my user base was global, I'd deploy to Oregon or Ireland for cleaner energy. For Australia-focused, Sydney is fine but not ideal.

- **Multi-region with intelligent routing:** Deploy to multiple regions (Sydney + Oregon) and route users to the nearest region. This reduces long-distance data transfer (which uses more network equipment and energy).

- **Carbon-aware computing:** Use services like AWS Carbon Footprint Tool to track emissions. Could implement "green mode" where non-urgent transcoding jobs are scheduled for times when the grid has more renewable energy (e.g., sunny afternoons for solar, windy days for wind).

### Resources Level: Storage and Data Transfer

**Current choices:**

- **S3 Lifecycle Policies:** (I should implement this if I haven't) Move old videos to S3 Glacier after 90 days. Videos that haven't been watched in 6 months go to Glacier Deep Archive. This uses tape storage instead of spinning disks, saving significant energy.

- **CloudFront edge caching:** Serving the React app from edge locations reduces data transfer distance. Instead of every request going to Sydney, users in Tokyo hit the Tokyo edge location. Shorter distance = less router/switch hops = less network energy.

**What I could improve:**

- **Aggressive video lifecycle:**
  - Day 0-30: S3 Standard (frequently accessed, instant retrieval)
  - Day 31-90: S3 Intelligent-Tiering (automatically moves between tiers)
  - Day 91-365: S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval (60% cheaper storage, millisecond access)
  - Day 365+: S3 Glacier Deep Archive (95% cheaper, 12-hour retrieval)

  Most videos are watched in the first week after upload. Archiving old videos saves energy and money.

- **Delete unused data:** Implement a policy where videos with zero views after 2 years are automatically deleted (with user notification). Every byte stored requires energy to maintain, replicate, and backup.

- **Compress video metadata:** Right now storing full JSON objects in DynamoDB. I could compress metadata (gzip) or use more efficient encoding (Protocol Buffers). Smaller data = less storage, less transfer.

- **Deduplicate videos:** If two users upload the same video, detect duplicates (using perceptual hashing) and store only one copy. Reference the same S3 object in both users' metadata. Saves storage and transcoding energy.

- **Request compression:** Enable Brotli/Gzip compression on API responses. A 500KB video list compresses to ~50KB. Less bandwidth = less energy for routers, switches, and user devices.

### Additional Improvements (If Expanding Functionality)

Suppose the app added these features - here's how to keep them sustainable:

**Live Streaming:**
- Use AWS MediaLive with auto-scaling. Only run encoding resources when someone is actually streaming.
- Use WebRTC for peer-to-peer when possible (reduces server load).
- Lower default stream quality from 1080p to 720p, upgrade on demand.

**AI Features (e.g., content moderation, auto-tagging):**
- Use AWS Rekognition (pay-per-use) instead of running ML models 24/7.
- Batch process videos overnight when energy is cheaper and grid is cleaner.
- Use pre-trained models instead of training custom models (training ML models uses massive energy).

**Mobile Apps:**
- Design for offline-first. Users can download videos on WiFi, watch offline. Reduces mobile network energy (cellular uses more power than WiFi).
- Implement lazy loading and infinite scroll efficiently (fewer API calls).

**Analytics:**
- Use CloudWatch metric sampling instead of logging every request. Logging 100% of traffic is overkill and wastes storage.
- Aggregate data before storing (e.g., store hourly video view counts, not every individual view event).

### Measuring Impact

**How to track sustainability improvements:**

- **AWS Carbon Footprint Tool:** Shows estimated carbon emissions for your AWS usage. Track this over time.
  
- **Cost as a proxy:** In cloud, cost often correlates with energy usage. If the bill drops 30%, energy usage probably dropped similarly.

- **Metrics to monitor:**
  - Storage used (GB) → Less storage = less energy
  - Data transfer out (GB) → Less bandwidth = less network energy
  - Compute hours → Less runtime = less CPU energy
  - Idle time percentage → More idle time = better utilization

### Summary Table

| Level | Current Implementation | Improvements | Impact |
|-------|------------------------|--------------|--------|
| **Software** | Scale-to-zero, async processing | GPU transcoding, AV1 codec, lazy transcoding | -50% transcoding energy |
| **Hardware** | Fargate, right-sized tasks | ARM64 (Graviton2), Spot Instances | -60% per-task energy |
| **Data Centre** | Sydney region | Oregon region, renewable energy, carbon-aware scheduling | -40% carbon emissions |
| **Resources** | CloudFront caching | Lifecycle policies (Glacier), deduplication, compression | -70% storage energy |

**Overall potential impact:** With all improvements, could reduce energy consumption by 50-70% while maintaining the same functionality. This also saves costs (sustainability and cost optimization often align). Most importantly, as the app scales to 10,000 users, energy per user drops significantly due to economies of scale.
