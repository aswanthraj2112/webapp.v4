### **[00:30 - 02:00] SCENE 2: Architecture Overview**

**What to show:** AWS Console → ECS Dashboard

**Script:**
> "First, let me show you the architecture. I've deployed three microservices on AWS ECS Fargate: the Video API, the Admin Service, and the Transcode Worker. All services are running in a private VPC and accessed through an Application Load Balancer with HTTPS enabled."

**Actions:**
1. Open **AWS Console → ECS → Clusters**
2. Click on `n11817143-app-cluster`
3. Show **Services tab** - Point out 3 services
4. Click on each service briefly to show:
   - Desired count: 2, 1, 0 (Video API, Admin, Worker)
   - Task definition
   - Health status

**Script continues:**
> "Notice the Transcode Worker is currently scaled to zero because there are no videos to process. We'll see it automatically scale up when we upload a video shortly."

**AWS Services to Show:**

   Progress: 25%... 50%... 75%... 100%
   Upload complete
   ```

**Split Screen (optional):**
- Show CloudWatch Metrics for `transcode-worker`:
  - CPU Utilization spiking to 70-80%
  - Memory usage increasing

**Script continues:**
> "The worker scaled up automatically based on the SQS queue depth. It's now downloading the video, transcoding it with FFmpeg, and uploading the result back to S3. This process takes about 2-5 minutes for a typical video."

**Fast-forward option:** 
> "I'll speed up this part since transcoding takes a few minutes..."
> *[Use video editing to fast-forward through the processing]* or
> *[Split screen showing logs + describe what's happening]*

**Actions after processing:**
8. Wait for logs to show: `Transcode complete. Updating DynamoDB...`
9. Go back to **SQS** → Show **Messages available: 0** (message was deleted)
10. Go back to **ECS Service** → Show **Desired tasks** will eventually scale back to 0 (after cooldown)

**Script continues:**
> "After processing completes, the worker deletes the message from SQS. With no more jobs in the queue, the service will scale back to zero in about 5 minutes, saving costs. This is the key advantage of serverless-style scaling with ECS."

**Timestamp Note:** [7:00 - 9:00] - **Evidence for Auto-Scaling (3 marks) + Microservices (3 marks)**

## 🎬 Production Tips

### Recording Best Practices

1. **Audio Quality:**
   - Use a good microphone (headset mic is fine)
   - Record in a quiet room
   - Test audio levels before recording
   - Speak clearly and at a moderate pace

2. **Visual Clarity:**
   - Use 1920x1080 resolution
   - Zoom browser to 125-150% for readability
   - Hide bookmarks bar and unnecessary UI
   - Use full-screen mode for AWS Console
   - Highlight cursor (Windows: Settings → Ease of Access → Mouse pointer)

3. **Pacing:**
   - Don't rush - 12 minutes is plenty of time
   - Pause between scenes for easier editing
   - If you make a mistake, pause, then continue (edit later)

4. **Screen Layout:**
   - Consider split-screen for terminal + browser
   - Use picture-in-picture for your webcam (optional)
   - Keep tabs organized (AWS Console, Frontend, Terminal)

5. **Editing (Optional):**
   - Remove long pauses
   - Speed up transcoding wait times (2x or 4x)
   - Add text overlays for important points
   - Add timestamp markers in description

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Don't:**
- Rush through explanations
- Show sensitive info (AWS credentials, personal emails)
- Include unrelated browser tabs
- Record in low resolution (<1080p)
- Forget to test services before recording
- Skip the auto-scaling demonstration (it's 3 marks!)

✅ **Do:**
- Practice the flow once before recording
- Have all tabs pre-loaded
- Refresh pages to show real-time updates
- Explain *why* each component exists
- Show actual working features, not just configuration
- Keep energy in your voice (you're excited about your work!)
